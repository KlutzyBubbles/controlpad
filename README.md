# Controlpad

Program to add macro functionality to LaunchPad devices (currently only MK2).

## Building

NVM is not friendly with the project, instead use nodejs installed from the installer with windows build tools

You need to install the latest version of Visual Studio
including the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
For more information consult the documentation at:
